Emerald Rails adds a new rail for Fabric 1.21.11: the Emerald Rail.
It behaves like a Powered Rail (requires redstone power to activate), but when powered it provides 15× stronger acceleration than a vanilla Powered Rail — without changing Minecraft’s built-in minecart speed cap. That means you’ll hit the vanilla cap faster, but you won’t go faster than vanilla allows unless you use another mod to raise/remove that limit.

# Features
Works like a Powered Rail: powered by redstone signal.
When powered, 15× acceleration compared to vanilla Powered Rails.

# Crafting
to craft emerald rails, player needs 4 emeralds, 2 redstone dust and a breeze rod.
In a 3x3 crafting table, with this formation, the player can craft 6 emerald rails. (E: emerald, R: redstone dust, B: breeze rod.)

## NOTE:
This mod does not uncap minecart speed. Vanilla minecarts have a hard speed limit, so Emerald Rails mainly helps you reach top speed much faster.
For high-speed minecart systems, a speed/physics mod is strongly recommended and close to essential, since it’s the thing that actually removes/raises the cap and lets Emerald Rails show its full effect.
